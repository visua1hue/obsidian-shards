**Obsidian Shards** is a **personal collection** of modular CSS snippets meticulously crafted to optimize the visual appearance and functionality of my Obsidian interface. Each "shard" is designed to enhance specific UI elements, creating a cohesive and tailored setup that aligns perfectly with my workflow and preferences.

Inspired by the [Shimmering Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus) theme, these snippets focus on creating a minimalistic and clean user interface while maintaining essential functionality. Currently adjusted to complement and extend [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin) theme.

## Features
Consider using [Recursive Sans Linear](https://www.recursive.design/) and [Glyseric](https://www.behance.net/gallery/204616623/Glyseric-Free-Serif-Typeface), which complement the design and enhance readability.

- **Command Palette**: Custom adjustments for improved navigation and user focus within the interface
- **Enhanced Core UI**: CSS modifications to hide unnecessary elements - no Hider plugin required anymore
- **Settings**: Streamlined vertical navigation and enhanced highlighting for external plugins
- **New Tab**: Redesigned empty state for new tabs page
- **Editor**: Active line indicator for improved focus
- **Bullet Lists**: Animated transitions for collapsed list bullets
- **External Links**: Addition of Unicode symbols for enhanced recognition
- **Internal Links**: Subtle opacity adjustments for a cleaner interface.
