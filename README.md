**Obsidian Shards** — curated, modular CSS shards built for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Built with SCSS, each "shard fragment" is a modular component designed to enhance specific UI elements, optimizing the interface for productivity and visual clarity.

## Features

Consider using [Recursive Sans Linear](https://www.recursive.design/) and [Glyseric](https://www.behance.net/gallery/204616623/Glyseric-Free-Serif-Typeface), which complement the design and enhance readability.

- **Command Palette**: Custom adjustments for improved navigation and user focus within the interface
- **Enhanced Core UI**: CSS modifications to hide unnecessary elements - no Hider plugin required anymore
- **Settings**: Streamlined vertical navigation and enhanced highlighting for external plugins
- **New Tab**: Redesigned empty state for new tabs page
- **Editor**: Active line indicator for improved focus
- **Bullet Lists**: Animated transitions for collapsed list bullets
- **Unique Checkbox**: Animated playful transitions
- **External Links**: Addition of Unicode symbols for enhanced recognition
- **Internal Links**: Subtle opacity adjustments for a cleaner interface.
